Key identifying characteristics:

 #!/usr/bin/env nextflow - indicates this is a Nextflow script  

DSL declaration: nextflow.enable.dsl = 2 - specifies Nextflow DSL version 2  

Syntax:  


params {} blocks for parameter definitions

workflow {} blocks for workflow logic

process definitions for individual pipeline steps

This particular pipeline is designed for single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Cell Ranger and Seurat, combining both bioinformatics tools in a structured workflow. The pipeline includes processes for:

Cell Ranger counting  

Seurat quality control and filtering  

Sample integration  

Clustering analysis  

Marker gene identification  

Visualization  

Report generation  



Common Profiles to Use:

docker: Use Docker containers  

singularity: Use Singularity containers (HPC-friendly)  

conda: Use Conda environments  

slurm: Submit to SLURM scheduler  

test: Run with test data  


Prerequisites Summary:

Nextflow installed  

Cell Ranger software and reference genome  

R with Seurat and dependencies  

Container engine (Docker/Singularity) OR conda  

Raw 10X FASTQ files
